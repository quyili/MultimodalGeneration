#Synthesis of Registered Multimodal Brain MRI with Lesions
## Abstract
In a large number of data-driven medical image intelligent processing tasks, the collection and acquisition of medical image data is very difficult, especially the registered multimodal medical images data. Synthetic medical image data can well alleviate the problem of insufficient data. In this paper, based on the unsupervised conditional GAN model, we achieve the generation of registered multimodal medical images from random normal distribution matrix and corresponding lesion information can be efficiently generated based on the freely selected lesion label. We conducted a number of validation experiments on BRATS2015 to verify that our synthetic MRI can be used as pre-trained data or enhanced data in medical image intelligent processing tasks, and can greatly improve the generalization ability of the model.
