\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
在基于大量数据驱动的医学影像智能处理任务中，医学影像数据的收集和采集是非常困难的，尤其是配准的多模态医学影像数据。合成的医学影像数据可以很好地缓解数据不足的问题。生成对抗网络在计算机视觉任务中取得了广泛和稳定的优秀表现。我们基于当前表现优秀的生成对抗网络模型，通过无监督的训练，实现在已有单模态数据时可扩展出多模态影像数据并保留原模态的病灶信息，进一步实现完全从随机噪声生成配准的多模态医学影像并可自由添加病灶信息。合成的医学影像可以用于医学影像智能处理任务的预训练或者补充训练来提高模型的泛化能力。

\section{ Acknowledgments}
AAAI is especially grateful to Peter Patel Schneider for his work in implementing the aaai.sty file, liberally using the ideas of other style hackers, including Barbara Beeton. We also acknowledge with thanks the work of George Ferguson for his guide to using the style and BibTeX files --- which has been incorporated into this document --- and Hans Guesgen, who provided several timely modifications, as well as the many others who have, from time to time, sent in suggestions on improvements to the AAAI style. 

The preparation of the \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} files that implement these instructions was supported by Schlumberger Palo Alto Research, AT\&T Bell Laboratories, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, The Live Oak Press, LLC, and AAAI Press. Bibliography style changes were added by Sunil Issar. \verb+\+pubnote was added by J. Scott Penberthy. George Ferguson added support for printing the AAAI copyright slug. Additional changes to aaai.sty and aaai.bst have been made by the AAAI staff.

\noindent Thank you for reading these instructions carefully. We look forward to receiving your electronic files!
